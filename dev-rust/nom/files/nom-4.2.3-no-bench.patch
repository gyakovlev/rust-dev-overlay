Subject: Remove bench references in Cargo.toml and related deps

Due to the benchmarks being stripped, this crate doesn't work with
_ANY_ cargo commands, due to the hard references in Cargo.toml to
files that no longer exist.

Excess dependencies that were used in the stripped benchmarks
also removed.
